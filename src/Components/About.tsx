        <p className="text-lg">
          At Art Branch, we are dedicated to fostering a vibrant, supportive
          space where creativity thrives. Inspired by William Blake’s words,{" "}
          <em>
            "I must create a system or be enslaved by another man’s; I will not
            reason and compare: my business is to create."

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Our Story</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Like many creatives, I once set aside my artistic passions to focus on
          making ends meet. Over the years, I’ve seen countless talented
          individuals struggle for recognition. This realization led me to
          partner with IT specialist Ahmad, creating a platform where artists
          can showcase their work without social media pressures.
